# FinancialFoodTradingInsight

"FinancialFoodTradingInsight" is a GitHub repository that showcases the analysis of food trading data in a financial company's risk management department. The repository contains the results of a data analysis project that aimed to predict total product sales using linear regression and to predict the store from which the product was bought using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN). The repository includes the implementation of linear regression from scratch using both gradient descent and normal equation methods, as well as polynomial regression. The KNN algorithm was also implemented from scratch. The normality of the data was checked to ensure the validity of the predictions. The performance of the prediction models was evaluated using appropriate evaluation measures and visual representation, and various optimization techniques were used to improve the performance. The results of the analysis are presented in a format that can be easily understood by customers with non-technical backgrounds.
